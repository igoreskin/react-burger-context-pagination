## To start the App, please run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Starting the App will kick off two processes: the React App and a simple API. The API is powered by [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). You can refer to `json-server`'s documentation for updating, deleting and creating records. 

**The webserver can be found at:**

- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

**The API endpoint can be found at:**

- [http://localhost:3001/burgers](http://localhost:3001/burgers)
